## Project Requirements


- [ ] Accept a directory or a single log file as input.
- [ ] Utilize a cryptographic hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256, to compute hashes for each log file provided.
- [ ] On first use, store the computed hashes in a secure location.
- [ ] For subsequent uses, compare the newly computed hashes against the previously stored ones.
- [ ] Clearly report any discrepancies found as a result of the hash comparison, indicating possible file tampering.
- [ ] Allow for manual re-initialization of log file integrity.
- [ ] ./integrity-check init /var/log  # Initializes and stores hashes of all log files in the directory
- [ ] ./integrity-check check /var/log/syslog > Status: Modified (Hash mismatch) # Optionally report the files where hashes mismatched
- [ ] > ./integrity-check -check /var/log/auth.log > Status: Unmodified
- [ ] > ./integrity-check update /var/log/syslog > Hash updated successfully.

## Prerequisites

- Linux OS (AlamLinux 9.5 Minimal)

## How To Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/torshin5ergey/roadmapsh-file-integrity-checker
cd roadmapsh-file-integrity-checker
```
1. Ensure the `integrity-check.sh` script is executable
```bash
chmod +x integrity-check.sh
```
2. Run the script
